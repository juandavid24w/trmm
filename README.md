# Arcoteca

Library management software written in Django.

## Deployment

Check the `.env.example` for the required environmental variables, then
check the [Django documentation on
deployment](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/howto/deployment/)
for more information. The `requirements.txt` doesn't include database
adapter packages, so you might need to install them separately (e.g.
`psycopg` for postgresql or `mysqlclient` for MySQL/MariaDB).
